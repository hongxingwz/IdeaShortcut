# Highlighting Braces

This editor feature significantly improves readability of the code, and simplifies search for unclosed blocks or tags.

**To highlight block borders**

* Place the caret immediately after the block closing brace/bracket or before block opening brace/bracket

If the editor can find the block border, its braces, brackets or tags are highlighted with blue and a blue outline appears in the gutter area.

If the opening brace, bracket or tag is currently out of sight, you don't need to scroll to the beginning of the block. The editor shows a pop-up window on top that displays the beginning of the block.

If the editor cannot find the pair brace, bracket or tag, the unmatched one is highlighted with pink when the caret is placed next to it, and is underlined with a red curly line.
