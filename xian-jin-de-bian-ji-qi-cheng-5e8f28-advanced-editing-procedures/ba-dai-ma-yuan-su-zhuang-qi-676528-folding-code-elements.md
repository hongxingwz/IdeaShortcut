# Folding Code Elements

# Basics

You can collapse\(fold\) code fragments reducing them to a single visible line. In this way, you can hide the details that, at the moments, seem unimportant. If and when necessary, the folded code fragments can be expanded\(unfolded\).

Folded code fragments, normally, are shown as shaded ellipses\(...\).

## Code folding means

You can collapse and expand code fragments by using:

* Code folding toggles\(![](/assets/1506556560085.png), ![](/assets/1506556594148.png) or![](/assets/1506556626579.png) \). These toggles are shown in the editor to the left of the corresponding folding regions. If a region is unfolded, ![](/assets/1506556560085.png) indicates the beginning of the region while ![](/assets/1506556594148.png)is located at its end. For folded regions, the toggle is show as ![](/assets/1506556626579.png).

  If you hold the Alt key and click ![](/assets/1506556560085.png), ![](/assets/1506556594148.png) or![](/assets/1506556626579.png), the region is collapsed or expanded recursively, i.e. along with all its subordinate regions.
  
* Commands of the **Folding** menu and associated keyboard shortcuts.

  The **Folding** menu can be accessed from the main menu bar(**Code | Folding**), or as a context menu in the editor. The shortcuts are show right in the menu. See Commands of the Folding menu and associated shortcuts.
  
* Folded fragments themselves: click ... to expand the corresponding fragment. See also, Viewing folded code fragments.
