# Navigating with Bookmarks

## Introduction

The editor of IntelliJ IDEA provides two types of bookmarks:

* **Anonymous bookmarks **, indicated by check sings ![](/assets/1506611910246.png) in the left gutter. The number of anonymous bookmarks is unlimited.
* **Bookmarks with mnemonics** indicated by ![](/assets/1506611977732.png) or ![](/assets/1506611996569.png) icons in the left gutter. There can be only 10 numbered and 26 lettered bookmarks within a project.

All bookmarks are indicated with the black streaks in the marker bar:

Once created, the bookmarks enable you to easily jump to the desired location within a file, or across the entire project.

## Navigating within the current file

**To navigate through the bookmarks within the current file, do one of the following**

* On the main menu, choose **Navigate \| Bookmarks \| Next/Previous Bookmark**. The order of visiting bookmarks depends on their order in the collection of bookmarks in the Bookmarks dialog.

* Click the black streak in the marker bar.

## Navigating across a project

**To navigate across a project using numbered bookmarks**

* Use **Ctrl + Number** where the &lt;number&gt; corresponds to the desired bookmark.



**To navigate among all bookmarks in a project, do one of the following**

* On the main menu, choose **Navigate \| Bookmarks | Show Bookmarks**, or press ⌘F3

 In the Bookmarks dialog, select the target bookmark, and press ⏎.
 For your convenience, the target code preview is shown in the right pane of the dialog box.
 
* In the Favorites tool window, select the desired bookmark in the Bookmarks list, and then double-click the bookmark entry, or press ⌘↓. The corresponding file opens in the editor, with the caret at the beginning of the bookmarked line.
