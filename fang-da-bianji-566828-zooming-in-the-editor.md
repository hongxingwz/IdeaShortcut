# 放大编辑器


## 介绍
IntelliJ IDEA makes it possible to change font size (zoom) in the active editor, and reset font size to the default value. These operations apply to the active editor only. In the other editor tabs, font size is no affected.

## 激活放大
**To enable changing font size in the editor
**
*  Open the Settings/Preferences dialog, expand the **Editor** node, and click General.

*  Make sure that setting **Change font size(Zoom) with Ctrl + MouseWheel** is enabled

## 使用鼠标滚轮更改字体的大小
**To change font size using the mouse wheel**
* Place the caret in the editor.

* While keeping the Ctrl/⌘ key pressed, rotate the mouse wheel. As you rotate the mouse wheel forward, font size grows larger; as you rotate the mouse wheel backwards, font size decreases.

  The macOs users can use trackpad "Pinch-to-Zoom" gesture to change size of the font and the whole editing area.
